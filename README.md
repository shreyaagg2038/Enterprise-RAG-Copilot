# Enterprise-RAG-Copilot
A production style Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for enterprise operations, built with LangChain, FAISS and FastAPI.  The system ingests public, enterprise-style operational documents and enables citation-backed question answering, along with basic evaluation and latency monitoring.

## Features

- Ingests pdf, md, txt, and csv documents
- Builds a persistent FAISS vector index
- Answers questions with citation-backed responses
- Logs retrieval and generation latency
- Includes a basic evaluation endpoint (LLM-as-judge)
- Uses Gemini on Vertex AI for answer generation and LLM-based evaluation
- Uses Vertex AI embeddings for document vectorization
- Performs semantic retrieval locally using a persistent FAISS index


## Architecture

- Documents are chunked and embedded using Vertex AI Embeddings
- Embeddings are stored locally in a persistent FAISS vector index
- User queries are embedded and matched against FAISS to retrieve relevant chunks
- Retrieved context is sent to Gemini (Vertex AI) for grounded answer generation
- Responses include citations and latency metrics
- An optional evaluation endpoint uses Gemini as an LLM-as-judge for faithfulness

## Data Sources

The `data/raw/` directory contains publicly available, enterprise-style operational documents used to demonstrate the RAG workflows.

The current dataset consists of **7 public documents** related to **incident handling and customer support**, spanning multiple file formats (CSV, PDF, Markdown). 
These documents represent different layers of enterprise operations, including industry standards, organizational policies and hands-on operational runbooks.

### Included Files

- **`customer_support_tickets.csv`**  
  An anonymized dataset of customer support tickets containing semi-structured metadata and free-text issue descriptions. 

- **`incident_handling_nist.pdf`**  
  The NIST SP 800-61 Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, an industry-standard reference defining best practices and lifecycle phases for incident response.

- **`incident_management_guide_enisa.pdf`**  
  A public incident management guide published by ENISA, outlining structured approaches to incident classification, coordination and resolution.

- **`incident_management_guide_google.pdf`**  
  A publicly available incident management guide based on Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices, describing roles, communication models and response workflows during incidents.

- **`incident_response_policy_gtel.pdf`**  
  A high-level incident response policy document defining organizational responsibilities, escalation paths and governance for incident handling.

- **`incident_response_plan_hack23ab.md`**  
  A process-oriented incident response plan describing how policies are operationalized across preparation, detection, containment, recovery and post-incident review phases.

- **`incident_response_runbook.md`**  
  A step-by-step operational runbook providing concrete actions to be taken during active incidents, representing hands-on guidance used by on-call and operations teams.

These documents are diverse in format (CSV, PDF, Markdown) and abstraction level (policy, process, runbook), reflect real enterprise knowledge bases and can be used to test document ingestion, retrieval accuracy,
citation grounding and end-to-end RAG behavior.

> Additional public or synthetic documents can be added to `data/raw/` to further expand the knowledge base and evaluate the system’s behavior under different document distributions.

## Setup

This project uses **Gemini on Vertex AI**. 
Authentication is handled using **Google Application Default Credentials (ADC)**.


#### 1. Configure environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit .env and set your Google Cloud project:
```bash
VERTEX_PROJECT=your_gcp_project_id
VERTEX_LOCATION=your_gcp_project_location
```

#### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Authenticate to Google Cloud
``` bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project your_gcp_project_id
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

#### 4. Start the API
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app
```

The service will be available at ```http://localhost:8000```

The following commands work for both Docker and Virtualenv once the service is running:

## Ingest Documents
Once the API is running, ingest all documents in ```data/raw/```:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ingest
```
This builds or updates the FAISS vector index.

## Ask a Question
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"What are the phases of incident handling?"}'
```
<img src="/images/ask.png"><br>

The response includes:
- A grounded answer
- Source citations
- Latency metrics
  
<img src="/images/ask_answer.png"><br>

## Evaluate an Answer
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/eval \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"What are the phases of incident handling?", "answer":"..."}'
```
<img src="/images/eval.png"><br>

This endpoint uses an LLM-as-judge to estimate answer faithfulness and citation
behavior.

### Example Use Cases
- What are the phases of incident response according to NIST?
- What should happen after a P0 incident is resolved?
- What responsibilities are defined in the incident response policy?
- What types of issues appear most frequently in customer support tickets?
